# Abstract Art

This code creates a canvas element and uses JavaScript to draw an abstract art by randomly generating colors and rectangles on the canvas. The `randomColor` function generates a random RGB color, and the `draw` function fills the canvas with a random color and draws 50 rectangles with random colors, positions, and sizes. The `requestAnimationFrame` method is used to create a smooth animation loop, allowing the art to continually change over time. The CSS style sets a border around the canvas element for visual effect.
